# Internship Tracker

This is a simple web app I built using Python and Flask to help students keep track of internship opportunities.

## What it does

- Add new internship openings  
- View all internships in a table  
- Filter by branch, stipend, and deadlines  
- Easy to use and works in your browser

## How to run it

1. Clone this repository and open the folder.
2. Install the required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the app using `python app.py`.
4. Then open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`.

## What's next

- Add reminders for deadlines   
- Improve the UI design  
- Deploy it online for public use
